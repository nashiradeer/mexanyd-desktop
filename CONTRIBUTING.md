# Mexanyd Desktop // Contributing

## How to make contributions?

First, create your branch following [Hydrogen's Branch Naming Convention](#branches) and commits using [Hydrogen's Commit Standard](#commits), remember that your branch needs to have only one change, this doesn't mean how many commits or how many files were affected but what has been changed (if you are changing how commands are handled, you will not fix a bug in the music player for example).

After finishing your changes on your branch, create a Pull Request to the `main` branch, write a concise title in imperative, present tense (like `Change how commands are handled`) and describing what you have changed and why (if applicable), and a reviewer will approve close or comment, and depending on the decision of the reviewer, your branch will be merged. Consider that if your Pull Request is approved this doesn't mean it will be merged, because this depends on what type (major, minor or patch) the next version will be, in this case, you will need to wait before seeing your changes on the upstream.

Please, don't forget to log your changes in the [CHANGELOG.md file](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a changelog v1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) before making the Pull Request.

## Standards and conventions

### Commits

The Hydrogen's Commit Standard is based on [Angular's Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) with a simpler format that only the header (`<type>(<scope>): <subject>`) is present.

#### Commit types

- build: Changes on the build system-related files. (like `Dockerfile`, `Cargo.toml` or `pubspec.yaml`)
- chore: Other types of changes like changes on the VSCode's `launch.json` or `.gitignore`.
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
- docs: Changes to the documentation files.
- feat: A new feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- i18n: Changes to the translation files. (Not used on this project)
- refactor: A code rewrite that doesn't affect the API.
- refactor!: A code rewrite that affects the API.

#### Commit scopes

Commit scopes describe what has been affected by the commit, below is a list of scopes used in this repository:

*There are no commit scopes on this project for now.*

If your commit is of type `i18n` you will use the file name without the extension and prefix (`app_pt.arb` becomes `pt`) as the scope.

You can omit the scope (example `feat: create new module for ...`) if your commit there's no scope documented or is from other types that don't `feat`, `fix`, `i18n` and `refactor`.

If is of type `build` the scope will be the tool/command used like `docker`, `cargo`, or `flutter`.

#### Commit subjects

A short description containing what happened on this commit using the imperative, present tense ("change" not "changed" nor "changes") with the first letter lowercase, not ending with a dot (.).

### Branches

Hydrogen's Branch Naming Conventions are based on the [Simplified Convention for Naming Branches](https://dev.to/varbsan/a-simplified-convention-for-naming-branches-and-commits-in-git-il4) and are similar to [Hydrogen's Commit Standard](#commits) and have the format `<type>/<description>`.

#### Branch type

- docs: Changes to the documentation files.
- feat: A new feature or refactor on some existing feature.
- fix: A bug fix.
- i18n: Changes to the translation files. (Not used on this project)
- chore: Changes to non-documented things, like CI or build system files.

#### Branch description

A short description containing what will be changed on that branch using the imperative, present tense ("change" not "changed" nor "changes").

### Changelog

The [Mexanyd Desktop's Changelog file](CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nashiradeer/mexanyd-desktop/releases) are based on [Keep a changelog v1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) without any change.
